    abstract = {{Most machine learning researchers perform quantitative experiments to estimate generalization error and compare the performance of different algorithms (in particular, their proposed algorithm). In order to be able to draw statistically convincing conclusions, it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates. This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators (that don't take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance. This is confirmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difficulty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied.}},

    abstract = {{For testing nested hypotheses from a Bayesian standpoint, a desirable condition is that the prior for the alternative model concentrates mass around the smaller, or null, model. For testing independence in contingency tables, the intrinsic priors satisfy this requirement. Furthermore, the degree of concentration of the priors is controlled by a discrete parameter, t, the training sample size, which plays an important role in the resulting answer. In this article we report on the robustness of the tests of independence for small or moderate sample sizes in contingency tables with respect to intrinsic priors with different degrees of concentration around the null. We compare these tests to frequentist tests and other robust Bayes tests. For large sample sizes, robustness is achieved because the intrinsic Bayesian tests are consistent. Examples using real and simulated data are given. Supplemental materials (technical details and data sets) are available online.}},

    abstract = {{Is there "information" about the stimulus given to the
subject within brain data? The brain decoding approach tries to
answer this question by means of machine learning algorithms. A
classifier is learned from  a small sample of brain data
that is class-labeled according to the stimuli provided to the
subject during the experiment. The classifier is tested on
a different small sample, the test set, in order to observe the
number of misclassifications. The idea is that accurate
prediction provides evidence of the presence of information about
stimuli within brain data. In this work we show the connection
between information theory and learning theory in order to bridge
the gap between the initial information question and the observed
number of classification errors on a small test set. We propose a
hierarchical model about this connection and a related statistical
test about the presence of information. This test lies within the
Bayesian hypothesis testing framework and is compared against the
classical binomial test of the null hypothesis testing
framework. We show the empirical similarity between the two tests and
present an application on a real neuroimaging dataset about a covert
spatial attention task.}},

@article{etzel2009introduction,
    abstract = {{Modern cognitive neuroscience often thinks at the interface between anatomy and function, hypothesizing that one structure is important for a task while another is not. A flexible and sensitive way to test such hypotheses is to evaluate the pattern of activity in the specific structures using multivariate classification techniques. These methods consider the activation patterns across groups of voxels, and so are consistent with current theories of how information is encoded in the brain: that the pattern of activity in brain areas is more important than the activity of single neurons or voxels. Classification techniques can identify many types of activation patterns, and patterns unique to each subject or shared across subjects. This paper is an introduction to applying classification methods to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, particularly for region of interest (ROI) based hypotheses. The first section describes the main steps required for such analyses while the second illustrates these steps using a simple example.}},

@article{olivetti2011bayesian,
    abstract = {{Research in cognitive neuroscience and in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is frequently concerned with finding evidence that a given brain area processes, or encodes, given stimuli. Experiments based on neuroimaging techniques consist of a stimulation protocol presented to a subject while his or her brain activity is being recorded. The question is then whether there is enough evidence of brain activity related to the stimuli within the recorded data. Finding a link between brain activity and stimuli has recently been proposed as a classification task, called brain decoding. A classifier that can accurately predict which stimuli were presented to the subject provides support for a positive answer to the question. However, it is only the answer for a given data set and the question still remains whether it is a general rule that will apply also to new data. In this paper we try to reliably answer the neuroscientific question about the presence of a significant link between brain activity and stimuli once we have the classification results. The proposed method is based on a Beta-Binomial model for the population of generalization errors of classifiers from multi-subject studies within the Bayesian hypothesis testing framework. We present an application on nine brain decoding investigations from a real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment about the relation between mental calculation and eye movements. ► Population inference from brain decoding studies relies on classical hypothesis testing and a set of approximations. ► A more accurate statistical test is proposed within the Bayesian hypothesis testing framework. ► The test is based on a hierarchical Beta-Binomial model linking the observed number of errors of each subject-specific classifier to the population parameters. ► An efficient algorithm to evaluate the test is provided. ► An application is presented on an fMRI study about the relation between mental calculation and eye movements.}},

To gain acceptance in applications where the subsequent decisions have serious consequences, e.g. choice of cancer therapy, any such decision support system must come with a reliable performance estimate. Tailored for small sample problems, cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (BTS) have been the most commonly used methods to determine such estimates in virtually all branches of science for the last 20 years. Here, we address the often overlooked fact that the uncertainty in a point estimate obtained with CV and BTS is unknown and quite large for small sample classification problems encountered in biomedical applications and elsewhere. To avoid this fundamental problem of employing CV and BTS, until improved alternatives have been established, we suggest that the final classification performance always should be reported in the form of a Bayesian confidence interval obtained from a simple holdout test or using some other method that yields conservative measures of the uncertainty.}},

In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of 'is there information about a variable of interest' (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely 'where is the information' (pattern localization) and 'how is that information encoded' (pattern characterization).}},

We tested the hypothesis that cortical circuits for spatial attention contribute to mental arithmetic in humans. We trained a multivariate classifier algorithm to infer the direction of an eye movement, left or right, from the brain activation measured in the posterior parietal cortex. Without further training, the classifier then generalized to an arithmetic task. Its left versus right classification could be used to sort out subtraction versus addition trials, whether performed with symbols or with sets of dots. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that mental arithmetic co-opts parietal circuitry associated with spatial coding.}},
